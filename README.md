Hello everyone ,in the next files you will be reading my code that I wrote during the "week 1(C)" in the "CS50" course by "HARVARD" university!!!!
p.s. That was pretty easy "week" but i was kinda bored in the starting day ,due to my other stuff, 
hence I completed it within 2 days :))))

Also, in the pack, I pinned the "CS50" library that is not quite neccessary to use,
but as I'm doing the "HARVARD" course, I thought why not to also use their library :)
